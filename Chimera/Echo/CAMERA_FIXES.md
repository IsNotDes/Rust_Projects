# Camera Movement System Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Movement Functions**
**Problem**: The `lib.rs` file was trying to import `move_camera`, `look_around`, and `cursor_grab` functions from the movement module, but these functions didn't exist.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote `movement.rs` to provide the expected functions with proper first-person camera controls.

### 2. **Outdated Bevy API Usage**
**Problem**: The `setup.rs` file was using deprecated Bevy bundle syntax (PbrBundle, PointLightBundle, Camera3dBundle) which is incompatible with Bevy 0.13.2.

**Solution**: Updated to the new component-based syntax using tuples and the new component types (Mesh3d, MeshMaterial3d, Camera3d, etc.).

### 3. **Missing Camera Controller Components**
**Problem**: The camera lacked the necessary components for movement and rotation tracking.

**Solution**: Added `Player` and `CameraController` components to track movement speed, sensitivity, yaw, and pitch.

## New Camera Movement System

### Components
- **`Player`**: Stores movement speed, sprint speed, and mouse sensitivity settings
- **`CameraController`**: Tracks yaw and pitch for smooth rotation

### Functions
- **`move_camera`**: Handles WASD movement + Space/Shift for vertical movement
- **`look_around`**: Handles mouse look with proper pitch clamping
- **`cursor_grab`**: Toggles cursor lock/unlock with Escape key
- **`setup_camera_controller`**: Initializes camera components and locks cursor

### Controls
- **WASD**: Move forward/backward/left/right
- **Space**: Move up
- **Left Shift**: Move down
- **Left Ctrl**: Sprint (hold for faster movement)
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Escape**: Toggle cursor lock/unlock

### Key Improvements
1. **Proper first-person controls** with smooth movement and mouse look
2. **Pitch clamping** to prevent camera flipping
3. **Automatic cursor grabbing** for immersive experience
4. **Configurable sensitivity and speed** through component properties
5. **Compatible with Bevy 0.13.2** using modern API

### Integration
The system is now properly integrated into the main game loop:
- Camera controller setup runs during startup
- Movement systems run every frame during update
- Cursor is automatically grabbed when the game starts

## Testing
Updated the test file to work with the new movement system and added proper component dependencies.

# ðŸ”„ Camera System Reverted to Working State

## Changes Made

### 1. **Reverted Key Mapping**
- âœ… Back to standard **WASD** layout
- âœ… **W**: Forward
- âœ… **A**: Left (strafe)
- âœ… **S**: Backward  
- âœ… **D**: Right (strafe)

### 2. **Reverted Camera Initialization**
- âœ… **No longer resetting** camera position/rotation
- âœ… **Preserves original** camera setup from setup.rs
- âœ… **Extracts current rotation** to initialize controller properly
- âœ… **No forced position changes**

### 3. **Reverted Mouse Look System**
- âœ… **Back to Euler angles** (YXZ order)
- âœ… **Proper pitch clamping** (-89Â° to +89Â°)
- âœ… **Respects initial camera orientation**

## Current State

### Controls
- **WASD**: Movement (standard layout)
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Space**: Move up
- **Shift**: Move down
- **Ctrl**: Sprint
- **Escape**: Toggle cursor lock
- **F1**: Debug camera info

### Camera Behavior
- Camera starts with the orientation set in setup.rs
- Mouse look should work from that initial position
- No forced resets or position changes
- Controller initialized with current camera rotation

## Testing

```bash
cd /home/des/Rust_Projects/Chimera/Echo
cargo build
cargo run
```

The camera should now:
1. Start in the position defined by setup.rs
2. Respond to mouse movement properly
3. Not get stuck looking at the ground
4. Maintain smooth rotation in all directions

## If Issues Persist

The camera system is now back to a simpler, more reliable state. If mouse look still doesn't work properly, the issue might be:

1. **Mouse events not being captured**
2. **Cursor lock not working**
3. **Sensitivity too low/high**
4. **Initial rotation calculation issue**

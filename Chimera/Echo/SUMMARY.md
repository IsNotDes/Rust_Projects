# Chimera//Echo Camera Movement System - Fixed and Enhanced

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

I have successfully corrected and enhanced the camera movement system in your Chimera//Echo Rust project. The camera now works properly with smooth, responsive first-person controls.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **Missing Functions**: The `lib.rs` was importing non-existent movement functions
2. **API Incompatibility**: Code was using deprecated Bevy 0.12 syntax instead of 0.13.2
3. **Component Mismatch**: Camera lacked proper movement and rotation tracking components
4. **Integration Problems**: Movement systems weren't properly connected to the game loop

## 🚀 New Features Added

### Enhanced Movement System:
- **Smooth WASD movement** with proper forward/backward/strafe controls
- **Mouse look** with pitch clamping to prevent camera flipping
- **Sprint functionality** (hold Left Ctrl for faster movement)
- **Vertical movement** (Space to go up, Left Shift to go down)
- **Cursor management** (Escape to toggle cursor lock/unlock)
- **Automatic cursor grab** on game start for immersive experience

### Technical Improvements:
- **Modern Bevy 0.13.2 API** usage throughout
- **Component-based architecture** with `Player` and `CameraController` components
- **Configurable settings** for speed, sprint speed, and mouse sensitivity
- **Proper system integration** with startup and update phases
- **Debug functionality** (F1 to print camera info)

## 🎮 Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **WASD** | Move forward/backward/left/right |
| **Space** | Move up |
| **Left Shift** | Move down |
| **Left Ctrl** | Sprint (hold for faster movement) |
| **Mouse** | Look around |
| **Escape** | Toggle cursor lock/unlock |
| **F1** | Debug camera info (development) |
